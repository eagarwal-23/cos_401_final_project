I wanted to bring you roses this morning;
But I had taken so many in my closed belts
That the tight knots could not contain them.

The bows burst. The roses flew away
In the wind, in the sea, all went away.
They followed the water, never to return.

The wave appeared red and as if on fire.
Tonight, my dress is still all scented with it...
Breathe in the fragrant memory of it on me.
