Horrible day! I was present, some hundred meters away, at B’s execution. I had only to pull the trigger on the machine gun and he was saved! We were on the heights overlooking Céreste, with weapons enough to break the bushes, and equal in number to the SS. They unaware of the fact that we were there. To the eyes everywhere around me that begged for the signal to open fire I responded no with a shake of the head... The June sun slid a polar cold into my bones.

He fell as though he didn’t even see his executioners, and so light, it seemed to me, that the least puff of wind must have lifted him off the earth.

I did not give the signal because this village had to be spared at any price. What is a village? A village like any other? Did he perhaps know, in that last instant?
