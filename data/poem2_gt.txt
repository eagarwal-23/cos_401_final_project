Under the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine
And our loves
He has to remind me of that
Joy always came after pain

Vienna the night strikes the hour
The days go away I remain

Hands in hands let's stay face to face
While under
The bridge of our arms passes
Eternal gazes the wave so weary

Vienna the night strikes the hour
The days go away I remain

Love goes away like this running water
Love flies away
how slow life is
And how violent Hope is

Vienna the night strikes the hour
The days go away I remain

The days pass and the weeks pass
Nor time spent
Neither loves return
Under the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine

Vienna the night strikes the hour
The days go away I remain
