Under the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine
And our loves
I have to remember it
Joy always came after sorrow

Vienna night is the hour
The days go by I remain

Hands in hands let us stand face to face
While underneath
The bridge of our arms passes
Of eternal glances the wave so weary

Vienna night sounds the hour
The days go by I remain

Love goes away like this running water
Love goes away
How slow is life
And how violent is Hope

Vienna night sounds the hour
The days are gone I remain

Days pass and weeks pass
Neither time passed
Nor loves come back
Under the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine

Vienna at night rings the hour
The days go by I remain
