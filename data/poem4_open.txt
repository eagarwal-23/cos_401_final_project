I wanted to bring you roses this morning;
But I had taken so many in my closed belt
That the knots were too tight to hold them.

The knots burst. The roses flew
In the wind, to the sea they all went.
They followed the water to never return.

The wave appeared red and like it was on fire.
Tonight my dress is still full of their scent...
Breathe in the fragrant memory on me.
