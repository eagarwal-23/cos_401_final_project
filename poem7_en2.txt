Horrible day! I witnessed, some hundred yards away, the execution of B. I had only to squeeze the trigger of my machine-gun and he could have been saved! We were on the high ground overlooking Céreste, the bushes bursting with weapons and at least equal in number to the SS. They didn’t know we were there. To the eyes all around me, begging me for the signal to open fire, I replied with a shake of the head... The June sun sent a polar chill through my bones.

He seemed unaware of his executioners as he fell, and so light that the slightest breath of wind would have lifted him from the ground.

I didn’t give the signal because the village had at all costs to be spared. What is a village? A village like any other? Perhaps he knew, at that final instant?
