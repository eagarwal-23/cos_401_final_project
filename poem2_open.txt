Under the Mirabeau Bridge flows the Seine
And our love
Do I have to remember
Joy always came after pain

The night falls, the hour rings
Days go by, I stay

Hands in hands, let's stay face to face
While under
The bridge of our arms passes
The eternal, weary eyes

The night falls, the hour rings
Days go by, I stay

Love leaves, like this flowing water
Love leaves
Like life is slow
And like Hope is violent

The night falls, the hour rings
Days go by, I stay

Days and weeks pass
Neither time passed
Nor love comes back
Under the Mirabeau Bridge flows the Seine

The night falls, the hour rings
Days go by, I stay
