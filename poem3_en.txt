It has been rediscovered.
What? Eternity.
It is the sea fled
With the sun.

Sentinel soul,
We whisper confession
Of the empty night
And the fiery day.

From human prayers,
From common spirits
You free yourself
And thus you fly.

Since from you alone,
Satin embers,
Duty breathes
No one says: at last.

No hope here,
No emergence.
Knowledge with patience,
Torment is certain.

It has been rediscovered.
What? Eternity.
It is the sea fled
with the sun.
