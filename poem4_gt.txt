I wanted to bring you some roses this morning;
But I had taken so many in my closed belts
That too tight knots could not contain them.

The knots have burst. The flown roses
In the wind, to the sea, they are all gone.
They followed the water never to return.

The wave seemed red and as if inflamed.
This evening, my dress is still all perfumed with it. . .
Breathe in the fragrant memory of it on me.
